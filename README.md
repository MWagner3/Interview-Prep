# Interview-Prep
Gearing up for interviews? This repository aims to hold all the resources needed to crush your next interview! 

At the time of creating this guide, I am a current student in the Front End program at the Turing School of Software and Design. In an effort to prepare for my first software job search, I've decided to make one giant resource for myself to get ready. 

While this resource will constantly be expanding over the next couple of months, feel free to fork it and use it for your own upcoming interview prep.

## Behavioral Questions
Many companies want to get to know YOU. Make sure that your answers reflect who you are as a person. If you are a career changer, sometimes it can help to share why you've made the switch to this new industry! 

1. *What are your weaknesses? What are your strengths?*
  - For both of these, make sure to highlight how you work to overcome your weakness, or how your strength can play a part in the organization!

2. *Tell me about yourself*
  - This'll be your elevator pitch! 
3. *Why do you want to be a software developer?*
4. *Tell me about a challenging interaction with a teammate*
5. *Tell me about a project you've completed that you're proud of*
6. *Tell me about a problem you faced and how you solved it*
7. *Tell me about a time you were under pressure- how did you handle it?*
8. *What motivates you?*
9. *What is the most helpful feedback you've ever received about yourself?*
10. *Why should we hire you?*

12. *Describe a time when you made a suggestion to improve something on a project that you were working on*
13. *Give me an example of the project or initiative that you started on your own*
14. *Describe a situation in which you met a major obstacle in order to complete a project. How did you deal with it?*
15. *Has there been a time on a project when you disagreed with someone? What did you do about it?*
16. *Describe a circumstance when you were not able to achieve a project goal that was set by your team. How did you work around that?*
17. *Describe a situation in which you experienced difficulty in getting others to accept your ideas? What was your approach?*
18. *How do you plan out a project?*
19. *Tell me about a time when you worked with someone who was not completing his or her share of the work. How did you handle the situation?*
20. *Describe a situation where you had to work in a team that didn‚Äôt get on very well. What happened? What did you do and what role did you take? How did the situation evolve?*

## Technical Challenges

## Coding Challenge Resources
There are plenty of coding challenge resources on the web that will help you work through problems that you might see in a technical interview challenge. Here are just a few!

- [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)
  - Many interviews will have "leetcode-esque" type questions. It could be helpful to get used to seeing problems written out in this structure.
- [Codewars](https://codewars.com/)
- [Codesignal](https://codesignal.com/developers/interview-practice/)
  - Similar to leetcode in structure, practice tests refresh every 24 hours. There is also an arcade mode where you can test your skills.
